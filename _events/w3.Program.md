### Poster Session

There will be posters available throughout the entire workshop to foster interaction and discussion. This provides an excellent opportunity for participants to engage with the research and ideas presented by their peers in an informal setting.

### Social Program

Throughout the event, there will be regular coffee breaks, providing an excellent opportunity to network and discuss ideas in a relaxed setting. Additionally, we will host an aperitivo, where you can enjoy light refreshments and informal conversations with fellow participants. A lunch will also be provided, giving everyone a chance to gather and share a meal together. All these social events will take place at the Department of Mathematics (DIMA), ensuring convenience and a friendly atmosphere. 

### Abstracts

 - *Software for staged tree models* (Manuele Leonelli): This tutorial will focus on the application of software for data analysis using staged tree models, a versatile class of statistical models designed to represent and reason about asymmetric dependence structures and sample spaces. Staged trees offer a flexible framework for modeling complex data dependencies, making them particularly valuable in various real-world scenarios. Participants will be guided through several case studies that highlight the practical utility of staged tree models. These case studies will demonstrate how the software can be employed to gain critical insights into data, uncovering patterns and relationships that might be overlooked by traditional methods. Through hands-on examples, attendees will learn how to build, analyze, and interpret staged tree models, leveraging the software’s capabilities to enhance their data analysis workflows.
 
 - *Algebraic statistics of tree models* (Eliana Duarte): TBA
