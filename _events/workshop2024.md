{% include image.html width="300px" file="images/geg.png" %}

The **1st trees4cat Workshop** (Trees for Categorical Data) aims at bringing together researchers working on the analysis of categorical data with complex, asymmetric dependence and sample space structures. Topics related to the workshop include, but are not limited to:

 - contingency tables
 - staged trees
 - asymptotic theory 
 - software implementations
 - algebraic statistics

This meeting builds up on past meetings on the topic organized in 2019 at the University of Glasgow and 2020 Online.
